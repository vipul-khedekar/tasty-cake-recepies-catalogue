        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a cake that children love.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate</li>
            <li>¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>1 ¾ cups milk, divided</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>Seven-Minute Frosting</li>
            <li>½ cup crushed peppermint hard candies</li>
            <li>3 drops red food coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Sift together the cake flour and salt.</li>
            <li>Melt chocolate and butter together in a double boiler. Turn into mixing bowl, and cool to room temperature; this mixture must be cool. Mix in the sugar. Blend in egg yolks and 1 cup milk.</li>
            <li>Pour in the flour and salt, and mix just until incorporated. Beat batter with electric mixer for 1 minute, and then blend in vanilla and 1/2 cup milk. Dissolve baking soda in the remaining 1/4 cup milk; stir into the batter quickly and thoroughly. Pour batter into prepared pans.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the surface of the cakes spring back lightly when pressed with a finger, about 30 minutes. Cool cakes on wire racks.</li>
            <li>Prepare Seven Minute Frosting, omitting vanilla (see Footnote for link). Tint the frosting a delicate pink with a few drops of food coloring, and add 1/4 cup crushed candy. Frost and fill the cooled cake. Garnish with bits of crushed candy.</li>
        </ol>
